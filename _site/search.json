I am also engaged in a range of wildlife conservation and statistics projects here. More detail is in my cv\nThe website\nThis is my personal website. It is a mixed bag of:\nlinks to my statistics teaching and blog articles about statistics, targeted at people uncomfortable with calculus and matrix algebra, but happy to think and to code;\nresources to help naturalists, particularly birders, enjoy discovering Sierra Leone’s fauna; and\nmy 2021 birding blog in which, hostage to fortune, I hope to see most (is all possible?) of Sierra Leone’s regularly occurring bird species and provide some information on where to find them and what their presence means, both for global bird conservation and for the people who live with them.\nIf the statistics content aims to be serious about inference, the birding content is simply anecdotes about my explorations. The two overlap occasionally.\n\n\n",

For European migrant species Collins Bird Guide gives a lot more detail, though not comprehensive on the winter plumages not seen in Europe. This book now has an excellent Android and Apple app with all the book’s text and images plus short audio calls. Now that Chappuis’ 11 CD bird calls of Central and West Africa is an out of print collectors’ item, the free to download library of bird call at xeno-canto covers most of Sierra Leone’s species, and vocalisations of a few missing ones such as Sierra Leone Prinia can be found the Macauley Library. There is no quick way to download all of Sierra Leone’s bird species’ calls from xeno-canto.\nOkNP\nsdcsav\n\n\n",
